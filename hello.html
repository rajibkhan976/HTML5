<p id="ettp">
<strong>Sweden</strong> <span class="highlight">(Swedish: Sverige  [ˈsværjɛ]  (About this sound listen)) </span>, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: About this sound Konungariket Sverige (help·info)), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and north and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund, a strait at the Swedish-Danish border. At 450,295 square kilometres (173,860 sq mi), Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area. Sweden has a total population of 10.2 million[3] of which 2.4 million has a foreign background.[12] It has a low population density of 22 inhabitants per square kilometre (57/sq mi). The highest concentration is in the southern half of the country. Per a unique Swedish definition where only 200 people constitute an urban area,[13] 86% of the population lives in urban areas.[14] In contrast, the OECD definition of the smallest urban system is 50.000 people[15]. According to the OECD definition, only 30.7% of Swedes live in urban areas.[16]
